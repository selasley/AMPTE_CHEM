Sum_CSV_FILES is a PySimpleGUI based app for summing 2d histogram csv files from
the AMPTE CHEM Webapp.  The summed file can be plotted in the webapp.

Sadly the PySimpleGUI project came to an end in 2025 - https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI

The apps in the zip archives still seem to work, but no guarantees.
